# GOOS in Elixir

This is an attempt to work through _[Growing Object-Oriented Software Guided by
Tests](http://www.growing-object-oriented-software.com/)_, but in Elixir, which
is not exactly known for being an object-oriented language … [or is
it?](https://elixirforum.com/t/the-oop-concept-according-to-erlang/21078/3)

It’s quite possible (a) that this is a terrible idea, (b) that I’ll get bored
and abandon it part-way through, or (c) both of the above.

I’ve previously [done this in Ruby](https://github.com/kerryb/goos-ruby).
